# DoubleR
Double R or RR - (Rickshaw Rush) is a hyper-causal android game.<br>
Double R is a mobile endless-runner driving game that reimagines classic lane-based gameplay through a culturally inspired lens. Players control a rickshaw navigating a stylized, cartoony environment, focusing on responsive movement and obstacle avoidance. The project is still under development.
